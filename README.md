# New_York_TaxiFare_Project
New York Taxi Fare competition from Kaggle. I have applied Linear Regression,  Random Forests and Gradient Boosting algorithms <br>

Trained model is also availible by the name 'xgb_model_final.joblib' <br>

Following is the link for the Dataset and the Competition page.

I will be updating the project by introducing the following changes which will improve the model score:
1) Improving the EDA : Scaling the numerical_cols and OneHotEncoding the categorical_cols
2) Use Emsembling to create a more efficient model
